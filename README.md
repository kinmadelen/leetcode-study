## Filename Guideline

- Create a directory per problem ‚Üí `###-name-of-the-problem`
- Create a markdown file with your username ‚Üí `madelen.md`
- Do not commit any files other than `.md`

## Code Review Guideline

- First understand the flow of the code.
- Then give a feedback, e.g.)
  - comment about the part where you think this person did well
  - ask why certain code is used
  - suggest more efficient code
  - share other ways to solve a problem
  - etc...
